### Hi there 👋

I'm Silja (she/her) - a coder and designer based out of Toronto, Canada. I'm currently studying engineering and designing websites. I love learning more about sustainable tech, and finding intersections between my architecture and engineering studies.

🌱 I’m currently learning ...  ThreeJS and Shaders (with <a href = "https://www.superhi.com/"> SuperHi </a> )

🧚 Next on the list ... experimenting with circuits
