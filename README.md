I'm Silja (she/her/they) - a coder and designer based out of Toronto, Canada. I'm currently studying engineering and designing websites. I love learning more about sustainable tech, and finding intersections between my architecture and engineering studies.

🌱 I’m currently learning ...  lots of fun things relating to security development!

🧚 Next on the list ... we'll see!
