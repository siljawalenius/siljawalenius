### Hi there 👋

I'm Silja (she/her) - a coder and designer based out of Toronto, Canada. I'm currently studying engineering and designing websites. I love learning more about sustainability and sustainable tech, and finding intersections between my architecture and engineering educations . 


🔭 I’m currently working on ...  SouperHi - a React site about soup recipes!

🌱 I’m currently learning ...  SparkAR and React (and Python ... slowly but surely)

🧚 Next on the list ... App development and webGL
