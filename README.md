### Hi there 👋

I'm Silja (she/her) - a coder and designer based out of Toronto, Canada. I'm currently studying engineering and designing websites. I love learning more about sustainable tech, and finding intersections between my architecture and engineering studies.  


🔭 I’m currently working on ...  a bunch of small shaders projects, a three js solar system, and a three js breathing app 

🌱 I’m currently learning ...  loads of webGL stuff 

🧚 Next on the list ... experimenting with circuits
