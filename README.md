### Hi there 👋

I'm Silja (she/her) - a coder and designer based out of Toronto, Canada. I'm currently studying engineering, and designing websites.


🔭 I’m currently working on ...  SouperHi - a React site about soup recipes!

🌱 I’m currently learning ...  SparkAR and React (and Python ... slowly but surely)

🎧 Current Jams - anything by <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/artist/6pmxr66tMAePxzOLfjGNcX?si=unyXulOtQ6yF5DQx82LTvA"> Beirut </a>
