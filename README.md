### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Silja (she/her) - an engineer and designer based out of Toronto, Canada. I love learning more about sustainable tech, and finding intersections between my architecture and engineering studies.  


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...  a new portfolio site ðŸ‘€

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...  lots of fun things relating to security development, and also how to knit!

ðŸ§š Next on the list ... project management with Superhi! 

ðŸŽ§ Current Jams - <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2gNshD82pELPnE2CYeCLkp?si=4def9e25997842ce"> palo santo playlist </a>

ðŸ“« How to reach me: My <a href = "https://www.siljawalenius.com/" > portfolio </a>, or instagram (@sillllllja)
